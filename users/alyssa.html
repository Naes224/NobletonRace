        <h1 class="title">Alyssa's Hint</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">I started making yours first. I have no idea why but I just had the sudden urge to call you gay in cursive.
            You and Guan-fucking-DOOKS! are probably bare confused as to what this is so i'll get on with it as quick as possible.
            This is a fun scavenger hunt with a prize at the end. I will be putting clues around Nobleton and you will have to 
            find them. This is basically the amazing race Nobleton. Robbie, Eric, Mok, Brendan, Calista are all a part 
            of the game as well. In fact, everyones message is catered toward their personality. Thats why I'm using a cursive font for you. Also because you're gay. I'll also be putting sussy statements in the clues to throw you guys off. Sometimes i'll be telling the 
            truth sometimes I'll be lying. But you'll never know. Also I made certain peoples clues more challenging than others but, you'll never know who's until after the game.
            P.S I hope you stop shitting plastic!
        </p>
