        <p class="paragraph">CUM_Mok, I'm so happy you're reading this. I can call you a fag in advance. So gas. This is the amazing race Nobleton, 
            basically you will go around Nobleton looking for clues. Once you find all of your clues there will be a prize at the end. The prize could
             be good or it could be bad but I dont know what it'll be yet. I know your big brain will try and speed run this. So your clues are going to 
             be harder than others. I love you but thats unfortunately how this is going to have to be. The people involved are Brendan, Alyssa, Calista, 
             Robbie and Eric. Good luck! You're gonna need it.
