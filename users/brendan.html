        <p class="paragraph">Hi BG. I wanna eat your ass. But more importantly this is the amazing race Nobleton. You're going to have to look for clues around Nobleton and whoever finds all the clues will eventually find the prize at the end. 
            The prize could be candy, balls or cum. But you wont find out unless you find all the clue. Im kidding the prize will be good. Idk what it is yet but it will be something everyone likes.
            The people involved are Eric, Robbie, Calista, Mok and Alyssa. Good Luck! You're gonna need it.
