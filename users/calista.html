        <p class="paragraph">Well well well. Guan fucking DOOKS. Welcome to the amazibng race Nobleton
            I hope you're excited. If you have your tump in your hand while reading this then you owe me a big mac, no cap. 
            This is a scavenger hunt with a price at the end. The people you're racing are Eric, Alyssa, Robbie, Brendan and marcus.
            You are going to go around nobleton looking for clue, whoever finds there clues the fastest and finds the prize wins whatever the price is.
            The Prize box has one of everyones favourite things. I'm not made of money so whatevers in there is what you get. It could be a vape or it could be 
            a stick I found on the floor. Regardless you win the prize. I might partner you up with Eric to piss you off though. Good Luck
