        <p class="paragraph">Bro bare FUCKING bello's. I cant believe a bello is actually being featured on the amazing race Nobleton. Basically you go around nobleton and look for clues
            some clues are easy and some clues are harder. Unfortunately you will be paired with Eric (for now) so get ready to deal with that nigerian for a while. The people involved are 
            Mok, Brendan, Eric, Calista and Alyssa. You will be working against each other to look for clues and once you find the final clue you will find the prize. I dont knwo what the prize is going to 
            be yet so you will have to just hop that its good. Good luck!
