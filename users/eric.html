        <p class="paragraph">Bruh saying bare niggers. Welcome to the amazing race Nobleton. Mans are gonna have to go around Nob looking for clues. Since you cant drive you're paired with Robbie
            (for now). Once you find all of your clues you will eventually find the prize. I have no idea what the prize is gonna be. It could be anything. I guess you have to find out. It could be an A&W burger
            could be a tump could be candy I have no idea. But mans aren't rich so you get what you get. Could even win a free dinner with Naes. So gas bare sushi.
